## Created by Carter and Patrick

### Question 1 is an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm - All functions and code done by Patrick
### Test cases
1. No resources are overcapped through RQ call
2. Resources are overcapped through RQ call

###Use examples
1. Managing the resources available to threads in a safe manner

###Features
1.Displays status of data structures containing information about the threads and resources
2.Allots available resources to threads in order to safely run them
3.Releases resources used by threads to make them available for use again
4.Runs the Banker's Algorithm in order to safely fulfill the needs of given customers/threads

### Question 2 is a Contiguous Memory Allocation Simulation
