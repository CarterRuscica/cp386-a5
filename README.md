## Created by Carter and Patrick

### Question 1 is an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm - All functions and code done by Patrick
### Test cases
1. No resources are overcapped through RQ call
2. Resources are overcapped through RQ call  

### Use examples
1. Managing the resources available to threads in a safe manner  

### Features
1.Displays status of data structures containing information about the threads and resources  

2.Allots available resources to threads in order to safely run them  

3.Releases resources used by threads to make them available for use again  

4.Runs the Banker's Algorithm in order to safely fulfill the needs of given customers/threads  

### Question 2 is a Contiguous Memory Allocation Simulation
Run the program by compiling with
'gcc Question2.c -o Question2'
'./Question2 <memory>'
  
Commands are:    
  RQ <process name> <memory> <algorithm>   
  RL <process name>    
  Status   
  Exit   
RQ is for resource allocation   
RL is for resource freeing   
Status is to see current resources    
Exit is to quit
